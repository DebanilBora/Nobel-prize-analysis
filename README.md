📊 Nobel Prize Data Analysis

An interactive data storytelling project exploring Nobel Prize trends across countries, categories, gender, institutions, and ages of laureates.

🔍 What I Did

Cleaned and processed the Nobel Prize dataset (1901–2020).

Created interactive dashboards with Plotly and insightful visuals using Matplotlib & Seaborn.

Explored key questions like:

📈 How has the number of prizes changed over time?

🌍 Which countries & institutions dominate Nobel Prizes?

👩‍🔬 What’s the gender split in different categories?

👶 At what age do most laureates win?

🌟 Insights

Nobel Prizes are historically dominated by men, but female representation is growing.

The USA leads in Nobel Prizes, followed by Europe.

Most laureates win in their 40s–60s, though it varies by category.

Research hubs (Cambridge, Harvard, etc.) appear as major prize hotspots.
